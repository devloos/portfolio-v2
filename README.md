## Information

### Client
- Tech Stack: Vite, Vue.js, Vercel
- Deploy is simple just push to main and vercel will pull latest
- Vercel takes latest code and builds it using vite (running `npm run build`)
- It then takes the output directory (dist) and serves it
- Uses node.js version 22
- Domain is CNAME record and Vercel gives the record an SSL Certificate (so does cloudflare)
- Vite prefixed ENV vars are compiled into the dist folder

### Server
- Tech Stack: Symfony PHP and Doctrine for ORM
- Server runs on an EC2 instance with installed PHP, Nginx, and Composer.
- Github action sets up the env file and copies current repo plus env to prod EC2
- We then run composer install
- We have a security group on the EC2 side that exposes port 80 and 443 to http traffic
- Nginx root is pointing to public symfony folder and reroutes traffic to php fpm
- Any nginx errors are logged here:
```
error_log /var/log/nginx/portfolio_error.log;
access_log /var/log/nginx/portfolio_access.log;
```
